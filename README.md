# learning-rust
My works from Rust Book



Notes for Chapter 1;

$ rustup -> Install the latest stable version of Rust
 
$ rustc -> execute & run a Rust program

$ cargo new hello_cargo -> creates a cargo project

$ cargo build -> creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo(.exe)

$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo -> execute the executable file you created in the previous step ($cargo build)

$ cargo run -> run the cargo program (use instead of $ cargo build)

$ cargo check -> checks the code to make sure it compiles without produce an executable (USE "$ cargo check" periodically)

$ cargo build --release -> compile the project with optimizations, create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug
